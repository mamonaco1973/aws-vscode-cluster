#
# Purpose:
#   Generate a self-signed TLS certificate and import it into ACM so the
#   Application Load Balancer can terminate HTTPS without a registered
#   domain or a public certificate authority.
#
# Why HTTPS is required rather than optional:
#   Over plain HTTP, carrier and ISP security products inspect page content
#   inline. In practice they classify an unbranded credential form on an
#   *.elb.amazonaws.com hostname as phishing and block it outright, and some
#   mobile carriers also mangle the WebSocket Upgrade handshake that
#   code-server depends on. TLS ends both behaviours — the middlebox can no
#   longer read or rewrite the stream.
#
# Trade-off:
#   Browsers do not trust a self-signed issuer, so users get an interstitial
#   warning and must choose "Advanced -> Proceed". The certificate's common
#   name is set to the ALB's own DNS name, so the warning covers only the
#   untrusted issuer, not a hostname mismatch.
#
#   To eliminate the warning entirely, replace this file with a DNS-validated
#   ACM certificate for a domain in Route 53 and point an alias record at the
#   ALB. See aws-resume-go/03-ecs/acm.tf for that pattern.

# No external tooling (openssl) is invoked, so apply.sh gains no dependency.
